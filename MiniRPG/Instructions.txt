Update BattleViewModel.cs.

Requirements:
• Modify damage calculation to factor in Player’s Attack and Defense.
• Example:
   int playerDamage = GameService.CalculateDamage() + Player.Attack;
   int enemyDamage = Math.Max(1, GameService.CalculateDamage() - Player.Defense);
• Apply these values when attacking and defending.
• Update log lines accordingly:
   $"You strike {CurrentEnemy} for {playerDamage} damage!"
• Add TODO: // Add enemy defense and attack scaling next

After you finish, update the Readme.md file with the changes.
