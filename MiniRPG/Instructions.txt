Update WorldMapViewModel.cs.

Requirements:
• Filter Regions list so only unlocked regions are visible:
   - Regions = new ObservableCollection(WorldMapService.GetRegions()
       .Where(r => FastTravelService.IsUnlocked(r.Name)));
• If no regions unlocked yet, automatically unlock “Greenfield Town”.
• After player visits a new region, call FastTravelService.UnlockRegion(regionName).
• Add TODO:
   // Add unlocking through quests or story events

---

After you finish, update the Readme.md file with the changes.
