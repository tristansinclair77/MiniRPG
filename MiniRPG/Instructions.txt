Testing checklist:
1. Win battles → gather materials.
2. Visit blacksmith → open Crafting menu.
3. Craft weapon or potion → verify inventory updates.
4. Enhance weapon → attack/defense values increase.
5. Save and reload → crafted and enhanced items persist.
6. Check insufficient materials case logs correctly.
7. Add TODO placeholders:
   <!-- TODO: Add unique recipes from quests -->
   <!-- TODO: Add legendary upgrade paths -->
   <!-- TODO: Add crafting minigame (timing-based success) -->

After you finish, update the Readme.md file with the changes.
