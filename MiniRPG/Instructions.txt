Enhance MapViewModel.cs.

Requirements:
• When constructing or refreshing NPCs:
   - NearbyNPCs = new ObservableCollection(region.NPCs
       .Where(npc => npc.IsAvailableNow()));
• Whenever TimeService.Hour changes significantly (e.g. after AdvanceHours),
   - Refresh NearbyNPCs list.
• Add log message when NPCs appear/disappear:
   - "Mira has gone home for the night."
   - "The shopkeeper has opened for the morning."
• Add TODO:
   // Add NPC pathfinding or animated map icons later

After you finish, update the Readme.md file with the changes.
