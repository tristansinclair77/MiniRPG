Testing checklist:
1. Gain a level → earn Skill Points.
2. Open Skill Tree → unlock “Power Strike.”
3. Start battle → select “Power Strike” → verify extra damage.
4. Save and reload → skill remains learned.
5. Ensure passive skills persist and reapply bonuses.
6. Add TODO placeholders:
   <!-- TODO: Add class specializations (Warrior, Mage, etc.) -->
   <!-- TODO: Add skill upgrade tiers -->
   <!-- TODO: Add skill synergy effects -->
