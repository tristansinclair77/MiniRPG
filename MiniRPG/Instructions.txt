Testing checklist:
1. Open World Map → see only unlocked regions.
2. Travel to a region → sometimes trigger random battle.
3. Complete “Goblin Problem” quest → unlock “Goblin Woods”.
4. Use “Fast Travel” to return to earlier towns.
5. Confirm gold decreases when traveling.
6. Save, exit, reload → verify unlocked regions and last location persist.
7. Add TODO placeholders:
   <!-- TODO: Add dynamic enemy scaling per region -->
   <!-- TODO: Add ambient music and travel animations -->
   <!-- TODO: Add cutscenes for first arrival to new region -->
