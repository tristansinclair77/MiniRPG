Create a new UserControl named ShopView.

XAML layout:
• Grid with two sections:
   - Left: ListBox of available shop items (binding: ShopInventory)
   - Right: Buttons "Buy" and "Sell", and a TextBlock showing "Gold: {Binding Player.Gold}"
• Underneath, display SelectedItem details (Name, Description, Price).
• Add TODO comments:
   <!-- TODO: Add shopkeeper portrait and themed background -->
   <!-- TODO: Replace with pixel UI and sound effects -->

---

After you finish, update the Readme.md file with the changes.
