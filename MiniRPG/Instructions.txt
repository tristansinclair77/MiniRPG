You are GitHub Copilot inside Visual Studio 2022.

Testing checklist:
1. Observe NPC availability during morning → some appear.
2. Rest or travel to advance hours → NPCs disappear or change.
3. Confirm environment color and ambient sounds change accordingly.
4. Enter buildings → verify NPCs at home at night.
5. Save and reload → time and environment persist.
6. Add TODO placeholders:
   <!-- TODO: Add festivals and events on specific days -->
   <!-- TODO: Add lighting for building windows at night -->
   <!-- TODO: Add time-based shop opening hours -->

After you finish, update the Readme.md file with the changes.
