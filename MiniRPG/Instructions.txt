Issues that need fixing:
1. When I click equip for "Armor", it doesn't display in the "Armor:" section of Equipment.
2. Skill Tree, Reputation, World Map and Fast Travel buttons go to a blank screen with the text "MiniRPG.ViewModels.(nameOfButton)" and nothing else exists. While I'm not sure what should exist here as I didn't write the code, it doesn't have a "Return" or "Back" button to escape the blank screen.
3. Buy button should only highlight when selecting a buyable item from a shop list.
4. Sell button should only highlight while in a shop that can accept sold items AND I'm selecting an item from my inventory that can be sold.
5. Add a "Sell All" button that sells everything in my inventory.
