Testing checklist:
1. Defeat enemies until equipment drops.
2. Equip weapon or armor → verify stat increase.
3. Fight again → confirm higher damage or defense values.
4. Save and restart game → ensure equipment persists.
5. Unequipped items remain in inventory.
6. Add TODO placeholders:
   <!-- TODO: Add equipment comparison screen -->
   <!-- TODO: Add accessory slot effects -->
   <!-- TODO: Add enchantments and rarity colors -->
