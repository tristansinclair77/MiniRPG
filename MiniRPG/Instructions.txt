Testing checklist:
1. Observe initial weather and lighting.
2. Advance time → weather changes randomly.
3. Confirm ambience audio updates (rain, snow, storm).
4. Observe lighting tint shifts (day/night + weather combined).
5. Progress through 30+ in-game days → verify season cycles.
6. Confirm seasonal weather variety and environment logs.
7. Save and reload → ensure weather, season, and time persist.
8. Add TODO placeholders:
   <!-- TODO: Add storm damage or travel delays -->
   <!-- TODO: Add seasonal events (harvest festival, snow day) -->
   <!-- TODO: Add region-based microclimates -->
---

After you finish, update the Readme.md file with the changes.
