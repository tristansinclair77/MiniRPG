# MiniRPG - Change Log

## Latest Update: Region Buildings Integration

### New Features ✨

#### Region.cs Model Updates
- **Added**: `ObservableCollection<Building> Buildings { get; set; }` property
  - **Purpose**: Allows regions to contain a collection of buildings
  - **Initialization**: Automatically initialized as empty collection in constructor
  - **Integration**: Connects Building model with Region model for location hierarchy
  - **Usage Example**:```csharp
var region = new Region("Greenfield Town", "A quiet settlement surrounded by plains.");
region.Buildings.Add(new Building("General Shop", "A shop selling supplies.", "Shop"));
#### WorldMapService.cs Updates
- **Updated**: Greenfield Town region now includes Buildings collection
  - **"General Shop"**:
    - Type: "Shop"
    - Description: "A well-stocked shop selling basic supplies and equipment."
  - **"Inn"**:
    - Type: "Inn"
    - Description: "A cozy inn where travelers can rest and recover."
  - **"Mira's Home"**:
    - Type: "House"
    - Description: "A cozy cottage where Mira lives."

#### Region.cs TODO Comment
- **Added**: New TODO comment for future enhancements:
  - `// Add unlockable guilds or special event locations`
  - Foundation for dynamic building unlocks
  - Support for special event-triggered locations
  - Guild system integration points

#### Purpose & Benefits
The Buildings integration provides:
- **Hierarchical Structure**: Regions now contain buildings as sub-locations
- **Content Organization**: NPCs, shops, and services can be organized by building
- **Immersive World**: Players can visualize distinct locations within regions
- **Extensible Design**: Foundation for building-specific interactions (shops, inns, guilds)
- **Quest Integration**: Buildings can be quest objectives or contain quest NPCs

#### Potential Future Enhancements
Based on the TODO comment:
- **Unlockable Guilds**: Player can join guilds housed in special buildings
  - Warrior's Guild, Mage's Guild, Thieves' Guild
  - Unlock after meeting requirements (level, quests, items)
  - Access to guild-specific quests and rewards
- **Special Event Locations**: Buildings that appear based on story progress
  - Seasonal event buildings (Festival Hall during celebrations)
  - Quest-triggered locations (Hidden Laboratory after completing quest chain)
  - Time-limited buildings (Traveling Merchant's Tent)
- **Building Interiors**: Navigate inside buildings to interact with NPCs and objects
- **Building Upgrades**: Improve buildings with player investment
- **Dynamic Availability**: Buildings appear/disappear based on game state

    - `string Description`: A descriptive text about the building
    - `string Type`: Building category (e.g., "Shop", "Inn", "House", "Guild")
