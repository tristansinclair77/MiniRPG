### Changes Made ✨

#### MapView.xaml - Time Information Display Added
- **Updated**: Region header now displays current day and time of day
  - **Location**: Region Name Header with Border (Grid.Row="0")
  - **Previous Layout**: Single horizontal StackPanel with region name
  - **New Layout**: Vertical StackPanel containing:
    - Region name (existing)
    - Time information (new)

- **Added**: Time Display TextBlock
  - **Text**: "Day {CurrentDay}, {TimeOfDay}"
  - **Binding**: 
    - `CurrentDay` - Bound to MapViewModel.CurrentDay property
    - `TimeOfDay` - Bound to MapViewModel.TimeOfDay property
  - **Styling**:
    - FontSize: 11 (small, subtle)
    - FontStyle: Italic
    - Foreground: #CCCCCC (light gray)
    - HorizontalAlignment: Center
    - Margin: 0,4,0,0 (4px spacing from region name)
  - **Format**: Uses multiple Run elements for flexible binding
  - **Purpose**: Display current game time at a glance

- **Added**: TODO Comments for Future Features
  - `<!-- TODO: Add animated sun/moon icons -->`
    - Animated icon next to time display
    - Sun during day (Morning, Afternoon)
    - Moon during night (Night, Evening)
    - Smooth transitions between icons
  - `<!-- TODO: Add day-night background tint -->`
    - Dynamic background color based on time of day
    - Night: Darker blue/purple tint
    - Morning: Bright, warm colors
    - Afternoon: Full brightness
    - Evening: Orange/red sunset tint
  - **Location**: Top of UserControl, with other TODO comments

#### MapViewModel.cs - Time Property Wrappers Added
- **Added**: CurrentDay Property
  - **Type**: `int` (read-only)
  - **Getter**: `=> TimeService.Day`
  - **Purpose**: Wrap TimeService.Day for UI binding
  - **Usage**: Displayed in MapView header
  - **Updates**: Automatically reflects TimeService changes

- **Added**: TimeOfDay Property
  - **Type**: `string` (read-only)
  - **Getter**: `=> TimeService.GetTimeOfDay()`
  - **Purpose**: Wrap TimeService.GetTimeOfDay() for UI binding
  - **Returns**: "Night", "Morning", "Afternoon", or "Evening"
  - **Usage**: Displayed in MapView header
  - **Updates**: Automatically reflects TimeService changes

#### Requirements Fulfilled

All requirements from Instructions.txt have been implemented:

**MapView.xaml:**
- ✅ TextBlock added near region name
- ✅ Shows "Day {Binding CurrentDay}, {Binding TimeOfDay}"
- ✅ Properties bound from MapViewModel
- ✅ Styled subtly (small italic font under header):
  - ✅ FontSize: 11 (small)
  - ✅ FontStyle: Italic
  - ✅ Positioned under region name
- ✅ TODO: Add animated sun/moon icons
- ✅ TODO: Add day-night background tint

**MapViewModel.cs:**
- ✅ CurrentDay property wrapping TimeService.Day
- ✅ TimeOfDay property wrapping TimeService.GetTimeOfDay()
- ✅ Properties accessible for data binding

#### Visual Example

**Before:**┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│  Current Region: Greenfield Town │
└─────────────────────────────────┘
**After:**
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│  Current Region: Greenfield Town │
│      Day 1, Morning              │
└─────────────────────────────────┘
**As Time Changes:**Day 1, Morning   → Day 1, Afternoon → Day 1, Evening
Day 1, Night     → Day 2, Morning   → Day 3, Afternoon
#### Integration Flow

**Time Display Updates:**
1. **Initial Load**: MapView loads, binds to CurrentDay and TimeOfDay
2. **Display**: Header shows "Day 1, Morning" (default TimeService values)
3. **Time Advances**: Game actions trigger TimeService.AdvanceHours()
4. **Property Update**: TimeOfDay getter returns new value from TimeService
5. **UI Refresh**: Binding system updates TextBlock display
6. **User Sees**: "Day 2, Evening" (or whatever the new time is)

**Example Time Progression:**
- **Start**: Day 1, Morning (Hour 8)
- **Player Rests**: AdvanceHours(8) → Day 1, Afternoon (Hour 16)
- **Player Explores**: AdvanceHours(6) → Day 1, Evening (Hour 22)
- **Player Rests Again**: AdvanceHours(8) → Day 2, Morning (Hour 6)

**PropertyChanged Considerations:**
- CurrentDay and TimeOfDay are read-only properties
- They return values directly from TimeService
- If TimeService is updated, the properties will return new values
- However, bindings won't auto-refresh unless OnPropertyChanged is called
- **Future Enhancement**: Add OnPropertyChanged notifications when TimeService updates
  - Option 1: TimeService fires events on time change
  - Option 2: MapViewModel calls OnPropertyChanged after advancing time
  - Option 3: Use INotifyPropertyChanged in TimeService

#### Code Examples

**MapView.xaml Time Display:**<TextBlock HorizontalAlignment="Center" 
           Margin="0,4,0,0" 
           FontSize="11" 
           FontStyle="Italic" 
           Foreground="#CCCCCC">
    <Run Text="Day " />
    <Run Text="{Binding CurrentDay, Mode=OneWay}" />
    <Run Text=", " />
    <Run Text="{Binding TimeOfDay, Mode=OneWay}" />
</TextBlock>
**MapViewModel.cs Properties:**/// <summary>
/// Gets the current day from TimeService for UI binding.
/// </summary>
public int CurrentDay => TimeService.Day;

/// <summary>
/// Gets the current time of day from TimeService for UI binding.
/// </summary>
public string TimeOfDay => TimeService.GetTimeOfDay();
**Usage in Game Code (Example):**// When player rests at inn
private void Rest()
{
    TimeService.AdvanceHours(8);
    Player.HP = Player.MaxHP;
    OnPropertyChanged(nameof(Player));
    OnPropertyChanged(nameof(CurrentDay));
    OnPropertyChanged(nameof(TimeOfDay));
    _globalLog?.Add($"You rest and recover all HP. It is now Day {CurrentDay}, {TimeOfDay}.");
}
#### Potential Future Enhancements

Based on the new TODO comments:

**Animated Sun/Moon Icons:**
- Icon displayed next to time text
- Image source bound to TimeOfDay:
  - "Morning" / "Afternoon" → sun.png (bright yellow sun)
  - "Evening" → sunset.png (orange sun)
  - "Night" → moon.png (white crescent moon)
- Rotation animation on icons:
  - Sun slowly rotates clockwise
  - Moon gently rocks back and forth
- Transition animation when time changes:
  - Sun fades out, moon fades in (day → night)
  - Moon fades out, sun fades in (night → day)
- Possible implementation:<Image Width="16" Height="16" 
       Source="{Binding TimeOfDayIcon}" 
       Margin="4,0,0,0">
    <Image.RenderTransform>
        <RotateTransform x:Name="IconRotation" CenterX="8" CenterY="8" />
    </Image.RenderTransform>
    <Image.Triggers>
        <EventTrigger RoutedEvent="Loaded">
            <BeginStoryboard>
                <Storyboard RepeatBehavior="Forever">
                    <DoubleAnimation Storyboard.TargetName="IconRotation"
                                     Storyboard.TargetProperty="Angle"
                                     From="0" To="360" Duration="0:0:10" />
                </Storyboard>
            </BeginStoryboard>
        </EventTrigger>
    </Image.Triggers>
  </Image>
**Day-Night Background Tint:**
- Apply color overlay to entire map background
- Tint color based on TimeOfDay:
  - "Morning" → Light blue (#E6F3FF, 30% opacity)
  - "Afternoon" → Transparent (no tint, full brightness)
  - "Evening" → Orange/red (#FF8C42, 20% opacity)
  - "Night" → Dark blue/purple (#1A1A3E, 60% opacity)
- Smooth color transitions:
  - Fade between tints over 2-3 seconds
  - Use ColorAnimation on Background property
- Possible implementation:<Grid.Background>
    <SolidColorBrush x:Name="DayNightTint" Color="Transparent" />
  </Grid.Background>private void UpdateDayNightTint()
{
    Color targetColor = TimeOfDay switch
    {
        "Morning" => Color.FromArgb(76, 230, 243, 255),   // Light blue
        "Afternoon" => Colors.Transparent,                 // No tint
        "Evening" => Color.FromArgb(51, 255, 140, 66),  // Orange
        "Night" => Color.FromArgb(153, 26, 26, 62),       // Dark blue
        _ => Colors.Transparent
    };
    // Animate DayNightTint.Color to targetColor
  }

## Previous Update: TimeService - Time Tracking System

### Changes Made ✨

#### TimeService.cs - Created Time Management Service
- **Created**: New static service for game time tracking
  - **Location**: `MiniRPG\Services\TimeService.cs`
  - **Type**: Static class for centralized time management
  - **Purpose**: Track game time (day/hour) and provide time-of-day information

- **Added**: Static Properties
  - **`int Day`**: Current day in the game world
    - **Initial Value**: 1 (starts at day 1)
    - **Purpose**: Track the passage of days in the game
    - **Usage**: Can be incremented when time advances past 24 hours
  
  - **`int Hour`**: Current hour in the game world (0-23)
    - **Initial Value**: 8 (starts at morning)
    - **Purpose**: Track the current hour within a 24-hour cycle
    - **Usage**: Used to determine time of day and advance time

- **Added**: Static Methods
  - **`AdvanceHours(int amount)`**: Advances game time by specified hours
    - **Parameters**: `amount` - Number of hours to advance
    - **Logic**: 
      - Adds amount to current Hour
      - If Hour >= 24, increments Day and wraps Hour using modulo 24
    - **Example**: 
      - Hour = 22, AdvanceHours(5) → Day increments, Hour = 3
      - Hour = 10, AdvanceHours(3) → Day unchanged, Hour = 13
    - **Usage**: Rest mechanics, travel time, quest timers

  - **`GetTimeOfDay()`**: Returns current time of day as string
    - **Return Values**:
      - `"Night"` - Hour < 6 (midnight to 5:59 AM)
      - `"Morning"` - Hour < 12 (6:00 AM to 11:59 AM)
      - `"Afternoon"` - Hour < 18 (12:00 PM to 5:59 PM)
      - `"Evening"` - Hour >= 18 (6:00 PM to 11:59 PM)
    - **Purpose**: Provide readable time of day for UI display and gameplay mechanics
    - **Usage**: NPC dialogue variations, shop hours, quest availability

- **Added**: TODO Comment
  - `// TODO: Add moon phases, seasons, and weather events later`
  - Foundation for future time-based features:
    - **Moon Phases**: Track lunar cycle (New Moon, Waxing, Full Moon, Waning)
    - **Seasons**: Track seasonal changes (Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter)
    - **Weather Events**: Dynamic weather based on season and time
  - Supports complex time-based gameplay mechanics

#### Requirements Fulfilled

All requirements from Instructions.txt have been implemented:

**TimeService.cs:**
- ✅ Static class created: `TimeService`
- ✅ Static property: `int Day = 1`
- ✅ Static property: `int Hour = 8` (start morning)
- ✅ Static method: `AdvanceHours(int amount)`
  - ✅ Logic: `Hour += amount`
  - ✅ Logic: If `Hour >= 24`, increment `Day` and `Hour %= 24`
- ✅ Static method: `GetTimeOfDay()`
  - ✅ If `Hour < 6` → `"Night"`
  - ✅ If `Hour < 12` → `"Morning"`
  - ✅ If `Hour < 18` → `"Afternoon"`
  - ✅ Else → `"Evening"`
- ✅ TODO Comment: `// Add moon phases, seasons, and weather events later`

#### Usage Examples

**Basic Time Advancement:**// Starting state
Console.WriteLine($"Day {TimeService.Day}, Hour {TimeService.Hour}"); // Day 1, Hour 8
Console.WriteLine(TimeService.GetTimeOfDay()); // "Morning"

// Advance 5 hours
TimeService.AdvanceHours(5);
Console.WriteLine($"Day {TimeService.Day}, Hour {TimeService.Hour}"); // Day 1, Hour 13
Console.WriteLine(TimeService.GetTimeOfDay()); // "Afternoon"

// Advance past midnight
TimeService.AdvanceHours(15);
Console.WriteLine($"Day {TimeService.Day}, Hour {TimeService.Hour}"); // Day 2, Hour 4
Console.WriteLine(TimeService.GetTimeOfDay()); // "Night"
**Integration with Inn Rest Mechanic:**// Player rests at inn (8 hours)
TimeService.AdvanceHours(8);
AddLog($"You rest until {TimeService.GetTimeOfDay()}. (Day {TimeService.Day}, {TimeService.Hour}:00)");
CurrentPlayer.HP = CurrentPlayer.MaxHP; // Restore HP
**Time-Based NPC Dialogue:**string greeting = TimeService.GetTimeOfDay() switch
{
    "Morning" => "Good morning, adventurer!",
    "Afternoon" => "Good afternoon! How can I help?",
    "Evening" => "Good evening! The day is almost done.",
    "Night" => "You're up late! What brings you here?",
    _ => "Hello!"
};
**Shop Hours Check:**bool IsShopOpen()
{
    // Shops open 8 AM to 8 PM
    return TimeService.Hour >= 8 && TimeService.Hour < 20;
}
#### Integration Flow

The TimeService can be integrated into various game systems:

1. **Inn Rest Mechanic**:
   - Player pays gold to rest
   - Call `TimeService.AdvanceHours(8)` to skip to next morning
   - Display message: "You rest until {TimeService.GetTimeOfDay()}"
   - Restore HP/MP

2. **Travel Time**:
   - Fast travel between regions takes time
   - Calculate distance-based hours
   - Call `TimeService.AdvanceHours(travelHours)`
   - Update UI with new time

3. **Quest Timers**:
   - Track quest deadlines by day
   - Check if `TimeService.Day > questDeadline`
   - Fail time-sensitive quests if overdue

4. **NPC Schedules**:
   - NPCs appear in different locations based on hour
   - Check `TimeService.Hour` to determine NPC availability
   - Update NPC dialogue based on time of day

5. **Shop Hours**:
   - Shops open/close based on hour
   - Disable shop interactions during closed hours
   - Display "Closed" message if `TimeService.Hour < 8 || `TimeService.Hour >= 20`

6. **Day/Night Visuals**:
   - Change background tint based on `GetTimeOfDay()`
   - Night: Darker tint, moon visible
   - Morning/Afternoon: Bright, sunny
   - Evening: Orange/red sunset colors

#### Potential Future Enhancements

Based on the TODO comment:

**Moon Phases:**
- Track lunar cycle (28-day cycle)
- Moon phase affects:
  - Werewolf encounters (more during full moon)
  - Magic power (stronger during full moon)
  - NPC behavior (some NPCs only appear during specific phases)
  - Visual: Display moon icon in UI
- Implementation:public static string GetMoonPhase()
{
    int cycleDay = Day % 28;
    return cycleDay switch
    {
        0 => "New Moon",
        7 => "Waxing Crescent",
        14 => "Full Moon",
        21 => "Waning Crescent",
        _ => "Waxing/Waning"
    };
}
**Seasons:**
- 4 seasons: Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter
- Each season lasts ~30 days
- Seasonal effects:
  - Weather patterns (more rain in spring, snow in winter)
  - Crop availability (harvest in fall)
  - Enemy types (ice enemies in winter, plant enemies in spring)
  - NPC festivals (harvest festival in fall)
  - Visual changes (snow overlay in winter, fall colors)
- Implementation:public static string GetSeason()
{
    int yearDay = Day % 120;
    return yearDay switch
    {
        < 30 => "Spring",
        < 60 => "Summer",
        < 90 => "Fall",
        _ => "Winter"
    };
}
**Weather Events:**
- Dynamic weather system
- Weather types: Clear, Cloudy, Rain, Snow, Storm
- Weather affects:
  - Movement speed (slower in snow/rain)
  - Encounter rates (fewer encounters in rain)
  - NPC behavior (NPCs stay indoors during storms)
  - Battle mechanics (lightning magic stronger during storms)
  - Visual effects (rain/snow particles)
- Weather influenced by:
  - Season (snow only in winter)
  - Time of day (storms more common in evening)
  - Random chance
- Implementation:public static string CurrentWeather { get; private set; } = "Clear";

private static void UpdateWeather()
{
    string season = GetSeason();
    double chance = Random.NextDouble();
    
    CurrentWeather = (season, chance) switch
    {
        ("Winter", < 0.3) => "Snow",
        ("Spring", < 0.4) => "Rain",
        (_, < 0.1) => "Storm",
        (_, < 0.3) => "Cloudy",
        _ => "Clear"
    };
}
**Additional Time Features:**
- **Minute Tracking**: Add `int Minute` property for finer time control
- **Real-Time Clock**: Optional real-time mode (1 minute = 1 game hour)
- **Time Display**: Format as "Day 5, 14:30 (Afternoon, Summer, Clear)"
- **Time Events**: Event system for specific times (e.g., "At Hour 12 on Day 10, trigger cutscene")
- **Calendar System**: Track specific dates, holidays, NPC birthdays
