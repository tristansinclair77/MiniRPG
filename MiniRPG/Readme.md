# MiniRPG - Change Log

## Latest Update: Fast Travel Command Enhancement

### New Features ✨

#### MapViewModel Fast Travel Command Addition
- **Added**: `OpenFastTravelCommand` - RelayCommand in MapViewModel
  - Triggers when player wants to open fast travel menu
  - Logs message: "Opening fast travel menu..."
  - Raises `OnOpenFastTravel` event to signal MainViewModel
  - Command binding: `{Binding OpenFastTravelCommand}` in MapView
- **Event Added**: `OnOpenFastTravel` event
  - Event signature: `Action?` (no parameters)
  - Signals to MainViewModel that player wants to open fast travel via world map
  - Follows established event-driven architecture pattern
  - Differentiated from `OnFastTravel` event which handles direct region travel
- **Enhanced**: `OpenFastTravel()` method
  - Added TODO comment: `// TODO: Replace temporary menu with town gate NPC or airship terminal UI`
  - Foundation for future NPC-based fast travel system (town gate guards, airship captains)
  - Currently raises event to open filtered world map

#### MainViewModel Fast Travel Menu Integration
- **Added**: Subscription to `MapViewModel.OnOpenFastTravel` event in `CreateMapViewModel()`
  - Creates new `WorldMapViewModel(CurrentPlayer)` when triggered
  - World map automatically filters to show only unlocked regions (existing functionality)
  - Subscribes to all WorldMapViewModel events:
    - `OnRandomEncounter` - Handles random battles during travel
    - `OnRegionSelected` - Updates current region and saves progress
    - `OnExitWorldMap` - Returns to MapView
  - Sets `CurrentViewModel` to WorldMapViewModel for display
  - Logs: "You open the fast travel menu."
  - Added TODO comment: `// TODO: Replace temporary menu with town gate NPC or airship terminal UI`
- **Integration Benefits**:
  - Provides alternative fast travel access through world map interface
  - Shows only unlocked regions automatically (leverages WorldMapViewModel filtering)
  - Maintains all travel safety features (no forced encounters like direct fast travel)
  - Consistent with existing world map travel system

#### Complete Fast Travel Command Flow
1. **Player Opens Fast Travel via Command**:
   - Player is in MapView
   - Clicks "Fast Travel" button (bound to `OpenFastTravelCommand`)
   - MapViewModel calls `OpenFastTravel()` method
   - Log message appears: "Opening fast travel menu..."
   - `OnOpenFastTravel` event raised
2. **MainViewModel Handles Event**:
   - Receives `OnOpenFastTravel` event
   - Creates new WorldMapViewModel with CurrentPlayer
   - Subscribes to world map events for travel handling
   - Sets CurrentViewModel to WorldMapViewModel
   - Logs: "You open the fast travel menu."
3. **World Map Display**:
   - WorldMapViewModel filters regions to show only unlocked ones
   - Player sees familiar world map interface
   - Only accessible/unlocked regions displayed as clickable buttons
4. **Region Selection**:
   - Player clicks a region button
   - WorldMapViewModel triggers `TravelCommand`
   - Travel logic executes (potential random encounter)
   - `OnRegionSelected` event fires with region data
5. **Region Transition**:
   - MainViewModel receives region selection
   - Updates `_currentRegion` and saves player progress
   - Returns to MapView with new region content loaded

#### Dual Fast Travel System
- **Direct Fast Travel** (Existing):
  - Uses Fast Travel Expander in MapView
  - Lists unlocked regions in ListBox
  - "Travel to Region" button triggers direct travel
  - `OnFastTravel` event with region name
  - No random encounters
- **World Map Fast Travel** (New):
  - Uses "Fast Travel" button to open world map
  - Shows visual world map interface with region cards
  - Click region directly on world map
  - `OnOpenFastTravel` event opens filtered world map
  - Potential random encounters during travel
  - More immersive visual experience

#### Integration Benefits
- **Flexible Access**: Two methods to fast travel based on player preference
- **Consistent Filtering**: Both systems use FastTravelService for unlock validation
- **Event-Driven**: Clean MVVM architecture with clear event separation
- **Visual Variety**: Players can choose list-based or map-based navigation
- **Safe Travel Option**: Direct fast travel bypasses encounters
- **Adventure Option**: World map fast travel includes encounter possibility
- **Future-Ready**: TODO comments establish path for NPC-based fast travel UI

#### User Experience Improvements
- **Choice**: Players can pick fast travel method based on gameplay style
- **Visual Feedback**: World map provides spatial context for travel
- **Clear Intent**: "Fast Travel" button clearly indicates functionality
- **Familiar Interface**: Reuses existing WorldMapView UI

- **Consistent Logging**: Both methods provide clear feedback messages

#### Technical Details
- **MapViewModel.cs Changes**:
  - Added `OnOpenFastTravel` event (Action?)
  - `OpenFastTravelCommand` calls `OpenFastTravel()` method

  - Added TODO comment matching MapViewModel
- **Dependencies**:
  - WorldMapViewModel for filtered region display
  - FastTravelService for unlock status (used by WorldMapViewModel)
  - Existing event system for region selection and encounters
- **Event Separation**:
  - `OnOpenFastTravel` - Opens world map interface
  - `OnFastTravel` - Direct travel to specific region
  - Clear distinction prevents implementation confusion

#### Future Enhancements
- **NPC-Based Fast Travel Interface**:
  - Town gate NPC offering carriage/wagon travel
  - Airship terminal captain NPC for flying travel
  - Portal master NPC for magical teleportation
  - Replace command with dialogue-based travel initiation
