## Gold Display Added to MapView and BattleView

- Updated MapView.xaml and BattleView.xaml user controls:
  - Added Gold display TextBlock in top-right corner of both views.
  - TextBlock bound to `{Binding Player.Gold, StringFormat='Gold: {0}'}` for proper data binding.
  - Positioned with `HorizontalAlignment="Right"` and `VerticalAlignment="Top"` for corner placement.
  - Uses gold theme color (#F9E97A) with bold font styling for visibility and consistency.
  - Set `Panel.ZIndex="10"` to ensure Gold display appears above other elements.
  - Added proper margins for spacing from view edges.
  - Player property binding works through existing DataContext in both MapViewModel and BattleViewModel.
  - Added required TODO comments:
    - `<!-- TODO: Replace text with animated coin icon -->`
    - `<!-- TODO: Add gold transaction animations -->`
  - Real-time updates when player gold changes through transactions, rewards, or shop purchases.
  - Provides consistent gold visibility across both main gameplay views for better user experience.

## Shop System Testing Checklist & Advanced TODOs Added

- Comprehensive shop system testing checklist implemented and documented:
  1. **Enter battles, win gold, collect loot** - BattleViewModel provides random gold rewards (5-20) and equipment drops
  2. **Go to Map → click "Shop"** - MapView Shop button properly navigates to ShopView through MainViewModel
  3. **Buy items → verify gold decreases and item added to inventory** - ShopViewModel BuyCommand validates gold, deducts cost, adds item to Player.Inventory
  4. **Sell items → verify gold increases and item removed** - ShopViewModel SellCommand finds matching inventory item, removes it, adds gold to Player
  5. **Leave shop → return to MapView** - ExitShopCommand properly triggers OnExitShop event handled by MainViewModel
  6. **Save game, restart → verify gold and inventory persist** - SaveLoadService handles complete Player serialization including Gold and Inventory collections
  7. **Gold display updates in real-time** - UI bindings reflect immediate changes during shop transactions across MapView and BattleView
- Added advanced feature TODO placeholders to ShopView.xaml:
  - `<!-- TODO: Add rare item rotation -->` - For periodic shop inventory changes with special items
  - `<!-- TODO: Add equipment upgrade system -->` - For item enhancement and modification mechanics  
  - `<!-- TODO: Add shopkeeper dialogue and art -->` - For immersive NPC interaction and visual character design
- Testing workflow validates complete shop economic system: earn gold → spend gold → inventory management → persistence → UI consistency.
- Shop system fully integrates with existing currency, inventory, equipment, and save/load systems for seamless gameplay experience.

- Created Quest.cs in Models folder implementing a comprehensive quest system foundation:
  - **Properties**: Title, Description, IsCompleted, RequiredKills, CurrentKills, RewardGold, RewardExp, RewardItem

  - **Completion Logic**: CheckProgress() method provides automatic quest completion detection
- Added future enhancement TODO placeholders:
  - `// TODO: Add quest types: Fetch, Deliver, Explore` - For expanding beyond kill-based quests
  - `// TODO: Add quest giver NPC info` - For associating quests with specific NPCs and dialogue
- Quest model follows established patterns from Item and Player classes for consistency
- Foundation ready for integration with quest UI, quest giver NPCs, and quest tracking systems
- Supports serialization for future quest persistence and save/load functionality
