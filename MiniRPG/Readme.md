# MiniRPG - Change Log

## Latest Update: World Map Integration

### New Features ✨

#### MapViewModel World Map Integration
- **Added**: `OpenWorldMapCommand` - RelayCommand in MapViewModel
  - Triggers when player wants to view the world map
  - Raises `OnOpenWorldMap` event to communicate with MainViewModel
- **Event Added**: `OnOpenWorldMap` event
  - Signals to MainViewModel that player wants to access world map
  - Follows established event-driven architecture pattern

#### MainViewModel World Map Management
- **Subscribed** to `MapViewModel.OnOpenWorldMap` event
  - When triggered, creates new `WorldMapViewModel` with CurrentPlayer
  - Sets CurrentViewModel to WorldMapViewModel for world map interaction
  - Logs message: "You open the world map."
- **Subscribed** to `WorldMapViewModel.OnRegionSelected` event
  - When player selects a region, stores it in `_currentRegion` field
  - Logs travel message: "Traveling to {selectedRegion.Name}..."
  - Returns to MapView after region selection
  - **Future**: Will load region-specific NPCs, enemies, and quests into MapViewModel
- **Subscribed** to `WorldMapViewModel.OnExitWorldMap` event
  - Returns to MapView when player closes world map without selecting a region
- **Added TODO Comments**:
  - `// Add animated fade-out/fade-in transitions between regions`
  - `// Add music change and environment effect system`

#### Complete System Flow
1. Player is in MapView
2. Player clicks "World Map" button (bound to `OpenWorldMapCommand`)
3. MapViewModel raises `OnOpenWorldMap` event
4. MainViewModel receives event and creates WorldMapViewModel
5. CurrentViewModel switches to WorldMapView
6. Player sees all available regions
7. Player clicks a region button, triggering `TravelCommand`
8. WorldMapViewModel raises `OnRegionSelected` event with region data
9. MainViewModel receives region selection and logs travel message
10. MainViewModel returns to MapView (future: load region-specific content)
11. **Future**: MapViewModel will display NPCs, enemies, and quests specific to selected region

#### Integration Benefits
- **Seamless Navigation**: Event-driven architecture ensures smooth view transitions
- **Region Context**: Selected region is tracked for future content loading
- **Consistent Pattern**: Follows same event subscription pattern as Shop, Quest Board, and Dialogue systems
- **Extensible Design**: Ready for region-specific content loading (NPCs, enemies, quests)
- **Logging Integration**: All world map actions are logged to GlobalLog

#### Future Enhancements
- Load region-specific NPCs into MapViewModel based on selected region
- Filter available enemies based on selected region
- Display region-specific quests on Quest Board
- Implement region unlock system
- Add travel cost deduction
- Implement random encounters during travel
- Add fade-out/fade-in transitions between regions
- Change background music based on selected region
- Add environment effects (weather, time of day) per region

## Previous Update: WorldMapViewModel Implementation

### New Features ✨

#### WorldMapViewModel Class Implementation
- **Added**: `WorldMapViewModel.cs` in the ViewModels folder
- **Inheritance**: Inherits from `BaseViewModel` for MVVM support
- **Properties**:
  - `Regions` - ObservableCollection<Region> containing all available regions
  - `SelectedRegion` - Region? tracking the currently selected region
  - `Player` - Player reference for travel validation and state management
- **Commands**:
  - `TravelCommand` - RelayCommand that accepts Region parameter for traveling to selected region
  - `ExitWorldMapCommand` - RelayCommand for closing the world map view
- **Events**:
  - `OnRegionSelected` - Event triggered when player travels to a region, passes Region info
  - `OnExitWorldMap` - Event triggered when player exits the world map
- **Constructor**:
  - Accepts `Player player` parameter
  - Initializes `Regions` collection from `WorldMapService.GetRegions()`
  - Sets up all commands with proper event handlers
- **Travel Logic**:
  - `Travel()` method validates region selection
  - Logs travel message: "Traveling to {region.Name}..."
  - Triggers `OnRegionSelected` event with region information
  - `CanTravel()` method for future travel cost and unlock validation
- **Integration Points**:
  - Connects to `WorldMapService` for region data
  - Event-driven architecture for parent ViewModel integration
  - Follows established MVVM patterns used in DialogueViewModel and MapViewModel
- **Future Enhancements**:
  - Travel cost deduction from player gold
  - Region unlock system based on player progress
  - Travel animations and transitions
  - Random encounter system during travel
  - Travel time and rest mechanics
- **Added TODO**: `// Add travel cost, animation, and random encounter system`

#### System Flow
1. WorldMapViewModel loads all regions from WorldMapService
2. Player views available regions in WorldMapView
3. Player clicks a region button, triggering TravelCommand
4. ViewModel validates travel (future: check costs and unlocks)
5. OnRegionSelected event fires with region data
6. Parent ViewModel (MainViewModel) handles region transition
7. Future: Implement travel animations, encounters, and region-specific content
