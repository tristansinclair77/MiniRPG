## Gold Display Added to MapView and BattleView

- Updated MapView.xaml and BattleView.xaml user controls:
  - Added Gold display TextBlock in top-right corner of both views.
  - TextBlock bound to `{Binding Player.Gold, StringFormat='Gold: {0}'}` for proper data binding.
  - Positioned with `HorizontalAlignment="Right"` and `VerticalAlignment="Top"` for corner placement.
  - Uses gold theme color (#F9E97A) with bold font styling for visibility and consistency.
  - Set `Panel.ZIndex="10"` to ensure Gold display appears above other elements.
  - Added proper margins for spacing from view edges.
  - Player property binding works through existing DataContext in both MapViewModel and BattleViewModel.
  - Added required TODO comments:
    - `<!-- TODO: Replace text with animated coin icon -->`
    - `<!-- TODO: Add gold transaction animations -->`
  - Real-time updates when player gold changes through transactions, rewards, or shop purchases.
  - Provides consistent gold visibility across both main gameplay views for better user experience.

## Shop System Testing Checklist & Advanced TODOs Added

- Comprehensive shop system testing checklist implemented and documented:
  1. **Enter battles, win gold, collect loot** - BattleViewModel provides random gold rewards (5-20) and equipment drops
  2. **Go to Map → click "Shop"** - MapView Shop button properly navigates to ShopView through MainViewModel
  3. **Buy items → verify gold decreases and item added to inventory** - ShopViewModel BuyCommand validates gold, deducts cost, adds item to Player.Inventory
  4. **Sell items → verify gold increases and item removed** - ShopViewModel SellCommand finds matching inventory item, removes it, adds gold to Player
  5. **Leave shop → return to MapView** - ExitShopCommand properly triggers OnExitShop event handled by MainViewModel
  6. **Save game, restart → verify gold and inventory persist** - SaveLoadService handles complete Player serialization including Gold and Inventory collections
  7. **Gold display updates in real-time** - UI bindings reflect immediate changes during shop transactions across MapView and BattleView
- Added advanced feature TODO placeholders to ShopView.xaml:
  - `<!-- TODO: Add rare item rotation -->` - For periodic shop inventory changes with special items
  - `<!-- TODO: Add equipment upgrade system -->` - For item enhancement and modification mechanics  
  - `<!-- TODO: Add shopkeeper dialogue and art -->` - For immersive NPC interaction and visual character design
- Testing workflow validates complete shop economic system: earn gold → spend gold → inventory management → persistence → UI consistency.
- Shop system fully integrates with existing currency, inventory, equipment, and save/load systems for seamless gameplay experience.

## Quest Model Added

- Created Quest.cs in Models folder implementing a comprehensive quest system foundation:
  - **Properties**: Title, Description, IsCompleted, RequiredKills, CurrentKills, RewardGold, RewardExp, RewardItem
  - **Constructor**: Accepts title, description, required kills, gold reward, experience reward, and optional item reward
  - **CheckProgress() Method**: Automatically sets IsCompleted = true when CurrentKills >= RequiredKills
  - **Example Usage**: `new Quest("Slime Hunt", "Defeat 3 Slimes terrorizing the outskirts.", 3, 50, 20)`
  - **Flexible Rewards**: Supports gold, experience, and optional item rewards for quest completion
  - **Kill Tracking**: CurrentKills property can be incremented as player defeats enemies
  - **Completion Logic**: CheckProgress() method provides automatic quest completion detection
- Added future enhancement TODO placeholders:
  - `// TODO: Add quest types: Fetch, Deliver, Explore` - For expanding beyond kill-based quests
  - `// TODO: Add quest giver NPC info` - For associating quests with specific NPCs and dialogue
- Quest model follows established patterns from Item and Player classes for consistency
- Foundation ready for integration with quest UI, quest giver NPCs, and quest tracking systems
- Supports serialization for future quest persistence and save/load functionality

## Player Quest System Integration

- Updated Player.cs in Models folder to implement comprehensive quest management:
  - **Quest Collections**: Added `ObservableCollection<Quest> ActiveQuests` and `ObservableCollection<Quest> CompletedQuests`
  - **AddQuest Method**: Simple method `AddQuest(Quest quest) => ActiveQuests.Add(quest)` to add new quests to active list
  - **CompleteQuest Method**: Full quest completion logic including:
    - Moves quest from ActiveQuests to CompletedQuests collections
    - Awards gold reward via `AddGold(quest.RewardGold)`
    - Awards experience via `GainExperience(quest.RewardExp)` with level-up handling
    - Awards item reward via `AddItem(quest.RewardItem)` if RewardItem is not null
    - Logs comprehensive reward message for debugging and tracking
  - **Automatic Rewards**: Quest completion automatically triggers all existing reward systems (gold, experience, inventory)
  - **Collection Management**: Proper quest state transitions between active and completed collections
  - **Integration**: Seamlessly integrates with existing Player systems (gold, experience, inventory, leveling)
- Added future enhancement TODO placeholder:
  - `// TODO: Later - add quest categories (Main, Side, Daily)` - For quest organization and filtering
- Added System.Linq using statement for collection operations (Contains, Remove methods)
- Quest system fully compatible with existing save/load functionality through ObservableCollection serialization
- Foundation ready for quest UI displays, quest tracking, and quest completion notifications
- Player quest management provides complete lifecycle: accept quest → track progress → complete quest → receive rewards

## QuestService Added

- Created QuestService.cs in Services folder implementing quest management utilities:
  - **Static Class Structure**: Follows established service patterns from GameService and SaveLoadService
  - **GetAvailableQuests() Method**: Returns List<Quest> with predefined sample quests including:
    - **"Slime Hunt"**: Defeat 3 Slimes, rewards 50 gold, 20 experience, and a Potion
    - **"Goblin Problem"**: Defeat 5 Goblins, rewards 100 gold, 40 experience, and an Iron Sword (+4 Attack)
  - **FindQuestByTitle() Method**: Searches available quests by title using case-insensitive comparison
  - **Comprehensive Quest Rewards**: Sample quests include both consumable and equipment rewards
  - **Equipment Integration**: Iron Sword reward includes proper IsEquippable, SlotType, and AttackBonus properties
- Added future enhancement TODO placeholders:
  - `// TODO: Add dynamic quest generation based on region and player level` - For procedural quest creation
  - `// TODO: Add quest chain progression` - For linked quest sequences and storylines
- Uses System.Linq for LINQ operations (FirstOrDefault method for quest searching)
- Quest service provides centralized quest management and can be expanded for:
  - Region-specific quests based on player location
  - Level-appropriate difficulty scaling
  - Quest prerequisite chains and branching storylines
  - Dynamic reward calculation based on player progression
- Foundation ready for integration with quest giver NPCs, quest UI, and quest tracking systems
- Follows established namespace patterns and coding conventions from existing service classes
