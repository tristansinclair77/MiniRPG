  - Uses gold theme color (#F9E97A) with bold font styling for visibility and consistency.
  - Set `Panel.ZIndex="10"` to ensure Gold display appears above other elements.
  - Added proper margins for spacing from view edges.
  - Player property binding works through existing DataContext in both MapViewModel and BattleViewModel.
  - Added required TODO comments:
    - `<!-- TODO: Replace text with animated coin icon -->`

## BattleViewModel Quest Tracking Integration

- **Quest Tracking on Enemy Defeat**: Modified BattleViewModel.cs to implement automatic quest progress tracking when enemies are defeated:
  - **Active Quest Iteration**: Added `foreach (var quest in Player.ActiveQuests)` loop in enemy defeat logic
  - **Enemy Name Matching**: Implemented `quest.Title.Contains(CurrentEnemy, StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase)` for case-insensitive enemy type detection
  - **Progress Tracking**: Increments `quest.CurrentKills++` for matching quests and calls `quest.CheckProgress()` for completion check
  - **Quest Completion**: When `quest.IsCompleted` becomes true, automatically calls `Player.CompleteQuest(quest)` to award rewards
  - **User Feedback**: Adds quest completion message `"Quest complete: {quest.Title}!"` to both CombatLog and GlobalLog
  - **Integration Point**: Quest tracking occurs immediately after enemy defeat confirmation but before experience/loot rewards
- **Future Enhancement TODO Comments Added**:
  - `// Add quest tracking popup and sound effect` - For visual and audio feedback when quest progress updates
  - `// Add enemy type classification for matching` - For more sophisticated enemy categorization beyond name matching
- **Quest Workflow Integration**: Complete quest lifecycle now functional in battles:
  - **Quest Acceptance**: Player accepts quests via Quest Board → quests added to Player.ActiveQuests
  - **Progress Tracking**: Player defeats enemies in battle → matching quests automatically track kills
  - **Quest Completion**: Kill requirements met → quest moves to CompletedQuests → rewards awarded immediately
  - **Reward Distribution**: Quest completion triggers gold, experience, and item rewards through existing Player methods
- **Real-Time Updates**: Quest progress updates are immediately visible in:
  - Combat log during battles showing quest completion messages
  - Global log for persistent quest completion tracking
  - Player.ActiveQuests collection for UI binding updates
  - Save/load system through existing Player serialization
- **Smart Matching Logic**: Case-insensitive enemy name detection allows flexible quest design:
  - "Slime Hunt" quest matches "Slime", "Forest Slime", "Giant Slime" enemies
  - "Goblin Problem" quest matches "Goblin", "Goblin Warrior", "Goblin Shaman" enemies
  - Future-proof for enemy variants and naming conventions

## Shop System Testing Checklist & Advanced TODOs Added

- Comprehensive shop system testing checklist implemented and documented:
  1. **Enter battles, win gold, collect loot** - BattleViewModel provides random gold rewards (5-20) and equipment drops
  2. **Go to Map → click "Shop"** - MapView Shop button properly navigates to ShopView through MainViewModel
  3. **Buy items → verify gold decreases and item added to inventory** - ShopViewModel BuyCommand validates gold, deducts cost, adds item to Player.Inventory
  4. **Sell items → verify gold increases and item removed** - ShopViewModel SellCommand finds matching inventory item, removes it, adds gold to Player
  5. **Leave shop → return to MapView** - ExitShopCommand properly triggers OnExitShop event handled by MainViewModel
  6. **Save game, restart → verify gold and inventory persist** - SaveLoadService handles complete Player serialization including Gold and Inventory collections
  7. **Gold display updates in real-time** - UI bindings reflect immediate changes during shop transactions across MapView and BattleView
- Added advanced feature TODO placeholders to ShopView.xaml:
  - `<!-- TODO: Add rare item rotation -->` - For periodic shop inventory changes with special items
  - `<!-- TODO: Add equipment upgrade system -->` - For item enhancement and modification mechanics  
  - `<!-- TODO: Add shopkeeper dialogue and art -->` - For immersive NPC interaction and visual character design
