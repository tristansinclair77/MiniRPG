## Latest Update: BuildingInteriorViewModel Exit Functionality Enhancement

### Changes Made ✨

#### BuildingInteriorViewModel.cs - Exit Building Event Implementation
- **Updated**: `ExitBuilding()` method
  - **Functionality**: Properly invokes `OnExitBuilding?.Invoke()` event
  - **Purpose**: Signals MainViewModel to switch back to MapViewModel
  - **TODO Comment Added**: `// TODO: Add fade-to-black transition between scenes`
    - Foundation for smooth visual transitions
    - Supports fade-out/fade-in animation when exiting buildings
    - Future enhancement for better UX

#### MainViewModel.cs - Event Listener Verification
- **Verified**: MainViewModel properly listens to `OnExitBuilding` event
  - **Handler**: `buildingVM.OnExitBuilding += () => ShowMap();`
  - **Action**: Calls `ShowMap()` which creates new MapViewModel with CurrentPlayer and currentRegion
  - **Result**: Seamless transition back to outdoor MapView after exiting building

#### Requirements Fulfilled
All requirements from Instructions.txt have been implemented:

**BuildingInteriorViewModel.cs:**
- ✅ Event: `Action OnExitBuilding` already declared
- ✅ Command: `ExitBuildingCommand` executes `OnExitBuilding?.Invoke()`
- ✅ TODO Comment: `// TODO: Add fade-to-black transition between scenes`

**MainViewModel.cs:**
- ✅ Listener: MainViewModel subscribes to `OnExitBuilding` event
- ✅ Handler: Switches back to MapViewModel(CurrentPlayer, currentRegion) via ShowMap()

#### Integration Flow
The complete building exit system now works as follows:

1. **BuildingInteriorView**: Player clicks "Exit" button
2. **BuildingInteriorViewModel**: ExitBuildingCommand executes
3. **ExitBuilding Method**: Invokes OnExitBuilding event
4. **MainViewModel Handler**: Receives event notification
5. **ShowMap Method**: Creates new MapViewModel with CurrentPlayer and current region
6. **View Transition**: CurrentViewModel switches back to MapView
7. **Player Location**: Returns to outdoor map in same region

#### Code Flow Example// In BuildingInteriorViewModel
private void ExitBuilding()
{
    // TODO: Add fade-to-black transition between scenes
    OnExitBuilding?.Invoke();
}

// In MainViewModel.CreateMapViewModel()
buildingVM.OnExitBuilding += () => ShowMap();

// ShowMap() creates fresh MapViewModel
private void ShowMap()
{
    var mapVM = CreateMapViewModel();
    CurrentViewModel = mapVM;
    try { AudioService.PlayMapTheme(); } catch { }
    AddLog("Switched to MapView");
}
#### Potential Future Enhancements
Based on the TODO comment:
- **Fade-to-Black Transition**:
  - Fade-out animation when exiting building
  - Black screen transition effect
  - Fade-in animation showing outdoor MapView
  - Reverse of entry animation for consistency
  - Duration: ~0.5-1.0 seconds for smooth experience
  
- **Exit Animation Variations**:
  - Different transitions based on building type
  - Door closing sound effects
  - Character sprite walking out animation
  - Time-of-day changes (e.g., enter during day, exit at night)
  
- **Context Preservation**:
  - Save player position near building entrance
  - Highlight exited building on map
  - Show "You left [Building Name]" notification
  - Brief cooldown before re-entering same building

**MapView.xaml:**
- ✅ Expander: Added with title "Buildings"
- ✅ ListBox: Bound to RegionBuildings
- ✅ Display: Each building's Name and Type shown
- ✅ Button: Labeled "Enter" bound to EnterBuildingCommand
- ✅ CommandParameter: Set to SelectedItem from BuildingListBox
- ✅ TODO Comment: `<!-- TODO: Add clickable building icons on visual map -->`
- ✅ TODO Comment: `<!-- TODO: Add building entry animation -->`

**MapViewModel.cs:**
- ✅ Property: `Building? SelectedBuilding` added for two-way binding support

#### Integration Flow
The complete buildings UI integration now works as follows:

1. **MapView Display**: Buildings Expander shows all buildings in RegionBuildings collection
2. **User Selection**: Player selects a building from the ListBox
3. **SelectedBuilding Property**: Updates via two-way binding
4. **Enter Button**: Enabled when a building is selected
5. **Command Execution**: EnterBuildingCommand executes with selected building as parameter
6. **Event Trigger**: OnEnterBuilding event fires in MapViewModel
7. **View Transition**: MainViewModel creates BuildingInteriorViewModel and switches view

#### UI Layout
The Buildings Expander appears in the MapView with the following structure:
Buildings ▼
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Building Name 1 (Type1)             │
│ Building Name 2 (Type2)             │
│ Building Name 3 (Type3)             │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
[        Enter        ]
#### Example Data Display
When a region has buildings, they appear as:
- "Mira's Home (House)"
- "General Store (Shop)"
- "Town Inn (Inn)"
- "Adventurer's Guild (Guild)"

## Previous Update: Building Entry System Integration

### Changes Made ✨

#### MapViewModel.cs - Building Entry Feature
- **Added**: `ObservableCollection<Building> RegionBuildings` property
  - **Purpose**: Display all buildings available in the current region
  - **Population**: Automatically populated from `Region.Buildings` in constructor
  - **Integration**: Allows UI to display and select buildings from the region
  - **Default Behavior**: Initialized as empty collection in legacy constructor

- **Added**: `ICommand EnterBuildingCommand`
  - **Type**: RelayCommand accepting Building parameter
  - **Purpose**: Command to enter a selected building
  - **Binding**: Can be bound to buttons in MapView UI with building as parameter
  - **Execution**: Triggers `OnEnterBuilding` event with selected building

- **Added**: `event Action<Building>? OnEnterBuilding`
  - **Purpose**: Event fired when player enters a building
  - **Parameters**: Selected Building instance
  - **Subscribers**: MainViewModel subscribes to coordinate view transition
  - **Usage**: Signals transition from outdoor MapView to indoor BuildingInteriorView

#### MainViewModel.cs - Building Entry Event Handling
- **Updated**: `CreateMapViewModel()` method
  - **Subscription Added**: Subscribe to `mapVM.OnEnterBuilding` event
  - **Event Handler Logic**:
    1. Create new `BuildingInteriorViewModel` with selected building and current player
    2. Subscribe to `OnTalkToNPC` event from BuildingInteriorViewModel
       - Create DialogueViewModel with NPC and player
       - Handle return to building interior after dialogue
       - Re-subscribe to building events after dialogue
    3. Subscribe to `OnExitBuilding` event
       - Returns to MapView via `ShowMap()` method
    4. Set CurrentViewModel to BuildingInteriorViewModel
    5. Add entry log message
  - **TODO Comment Added**: `// TODO: Add animated fade transition between outdoor and indoor views`
    - Foundation for smooth visual transitions
    - Supports fade-out/fade-in animation between exterior and interior

#### Requirements Fulfilled
All requirements from Instructions.txt have been implemented:

**MapViewModel:**
- ✅ Property: `ObservableCollection<Building> RegionBuildings`
- ✅ Population: Populated from `current Region.Buildings` in constructor
- ✅ Command: `RelayCommand EnterBuildingCommand` (accepts Building parameter)
- ✅ Event: `OnEnterBuilding(Building)` triggered when command is executed

**MainViewModel:**
- ✅ Subscription: Subscribed to `OnEnterBuilding` event from MapViewModel
- ✅ View Transition: Sets `CurrentViewModel = new BuildingInteriorViewModel(selectedBuilding, CurrentPlayer)`
- ✅ Subscription: Subscribed to `ExitBuilding` event to return to MapViewModel
- ✅ TODO Comment: `// Add animated fade transition between outdoor and indoor views`

#### Integration Flow
The complete building entry system now works as follows:

1. **MapView**: Player selects a building from RegionBuildings collection
2. **MapViewModel**: EnterBuildingCommand executes, triggers OnEnterBuilding event
3. **MainViewModel**: Receives event, creates BuildingInteriorViewModel
4. **BuildingInteriorView**: Displays building interior with NPCs and interactions
5. **Exit Options**:
   - Player
