# MiniRPG - Change Log

## Latest Update: Random Travel Encounter System

### New Features ✨

#### WorldMapViewModel Random Encounter Integration
- **Added**: `OnRandomEncounter` event in WorldMapViewModel.cs
  - Event signature: `Action<string>?` passing region name to trigger battle
  - Triggered when `EncounterService.ShouldTriggerEncounter()` returns true during travel
  - Passes target region name to enable region-specific enemy spawning
- **Enhanced**: `Travel()` method in WorldMapViewModel
  - After player selects a region, checks `EncounterService.ShouldTriggerEncounter()`
  - **If encounter triggered (25% chance)**:
    - Raises `OnRandomEncounter` event with region name
    - Battle occurs before reaching destination
  - **If no encounter**:
    - Raises `OnRegionSelected` event as normal
    - Player travels to region without interruption
- **Integration Benefits**:
  - Seamless integration with existing EncounterService
  - Region-aware encounters during travel
  - Event-driven architecture maintains MVVM pattern
  - No disruption to normal travel flow when no encounter occurs

#### MainViewModel Random Encounter Handling
- **Added**: Subscription to `WorldMapViewModel.OnRandomEncounter` event
  - Handler creates `BattleViewModel` with region name parameter
  - Logs message: "A wild enemy appears during travel!"
  - Switches `CurrentViewModel` to BattleViewModel for encounter
  - Plays battle theme music via `AudioService.PlayBattleTheme()`
- **Added**: `_targetRegion` field to track destination during encounter
  - Stores the region player was traveling to when encounter occurs
  - Enables resuming journey after battle concludes
  - Cleared after successful region transition
- **Enhanced**: Battle completion flow for travel encounters
  - After battle ends (victory, defeat, or run), delay 1 second
  - If `_targetRegion` is set:
    - Sets `_currentRegion` to `_targetRegion`
    - Updates `CurrentPlayer.LastRegionName` for save persistence
    - Calls `SaveLoadService.SavePlayer()` to auto-save
    - Logs: "Continuing journey to {region.Name}..."
    - Clears `_targetRegion` to prevent duplicate transitions
  - Returns to MapView with region-specific content loaded
- **Added TODO Comment**:
  - `// TODO: Add encounter animations and travel interruption visuals`
  - Foundation for visual effects when encounter interrupts travel

#### Complete Random Encounter Flow
1. **Player Initiates Travel**:
   - Player opens World Map from MapView
   - Selects a destination region (e.g., "Goblin Woods")
   - Clicks region button, triggering `TravelCommand`
2. **Encounter Check**:
   - WorldMapViewModel calls `EncounterService.ShouldTriggerEncounter()`
   - 25% chance returns true for random encounter
3. **Encounter Triggered Path**:
   - WorldMapViewModel raises `OnRandomEncounter("Goblin Woods")`
   - MainViewModel receives event and stores region in `_targetRegion`
   - Creates BattleViewModel with region name for region-specific enemy
   - Logs "A wild enemy appears during travel!"
   - Switches view to BattleView with battle music
   - Enemy spawned matches target region (Goblin or Goblin Chief for Goblin Woods)
4. **Battle Resolution**:
   - Player fights random encounter using normal battle system
   - Battle ends with victory, defeat, or escape
   - BattleViewModel raises `BattleEnded` event
5. **Post-Battle Region Transition**:
   - MainViewModel checks if `_targetRegion` is set
   - Updates `_currentRegion` to destination region
   - Saves player progress with `LastRegionName` updated
   - Logs "Continuing journey to {region.Name}..."
   - Creates MapViewModel with destination region data
   - Player arrives at intended destination
6. **No Encounter Path**:
   - If encounter check fails (75% chance):
   - WorldMapViewModel raises `OnRegionSelected` directly
   - Player travels to region immediately without battle
   - Normal region transition flow proceeds

#### Integration Benefits
- **Seamless Integration**: Uses existing EncounterService and BattleViewModel
- **Region-Aware**: Encounters spawn enemies appropriate to destination region
- **Event-Driven**: Maintains MVVM architecture with clean event subscriptions
- **Save Persistence**: Auto-saves after battle, preserving progress
- **Player Experience**: 
  - 25% encounter rate adds unpredictability to travel
  - Rewards preparation and strategy
  - Maintains sense of danger in world travel
- **Backward Compatible**: No changes to existing travel flow when no encounter occurs
- **Extensible**: Easy to add visual effects, animations, and encounter variations

#### Technical Details
- **WorldMapViewModel.cs**:
  - Added `OnRandomEncounter` event (Action<string>)
  - Modified `Travel()` method to check EncounterService
  - Conditional event raising based on encounter result
- **MainViewModel.cs**:
  - Added `_targetRegion` field (Region?)
  - Added OnRandomEncounter subscription in CreateMapViewModel()

  - Added TODO comment for encounter animations
- **Dependencies**:
  - EncounterService for encounter probability
  - GameService for region-specific enemy selection
  - BattleViewModel for encounter battle system
  - SaveLoadService for progress persistence

#### User Experience Flow
- **Visual Feedback**: Log messages keep player informed of travel status
- **Interruption Handling**: Battle interrupts travel but destination is preserved
- **Progress Preservation**: Auto-save ensures encounter results are not lost
- **Fair Challenge**: 25% rate balances risk vs. reward for travel

#### Load Game Region Restoration
- **Enhanced**: `OnTitleSelectionMade("Continue")` in MainViewModel
  - Checks if loaded player has a `LastRegionName` value
  - Queries `WorldMapService.GetRegions()` to find matching region
  - If region exists: Sets `_currentRegion` and loads player into that region
  - If region not found or null: Uses default behavior (no region selected)
  - Logs appropriate message: "Resuming adventure in {region.Name}..."

#### Complete Save/Load Flow
1. **New Game**: Player starts with `LastRegionName = null` (default behavior)
2. **Travel to Region**: Player opens world map and selects a region
3. **Auto-Save**: MainViewModel updates `LastRegionName` and saves player data
4. **Game Exit**: Player closes game with region progress saved
5. **Continue Game**: Player loads save file from title screen
6. **Region Restoration**: 
   - System reads `LastRegionName` from save data

  - Now passes `RegionName` to battle system instead of selected location
  - Changed from: `OnStartBattle?.Invoke(SelectedLocation ?? "Unknown");`
  - Changed to: `OnStartBattle?.Invoke(RegionName ?? "Unknown");`
  - Ensures battles spawn region-appropriate enemies

#### Complete Enemy Spawning Flow
1. Player selects a region from World Map (e.g., "Slime Plains")
2. MapViewModel is created with region-specific content
3. Player clicks "Fight!" button to start battle
4. MapViewModel passes `RegionName` through `OnStartBattle` event
