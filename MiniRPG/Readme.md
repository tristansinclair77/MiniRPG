## Latest Update: World Map Travel System - Complete Testing Checklist & TODO Comments

### New Features ✨

#### WorldMapView.xaml TODO Comments
- **Added**: Three new TODO comments for future enhancements:
  - `<!-- TODO: Add dynamic enemy scaling per region -->`
    - Foundation for scaling enemy difficulty based on region level
    - Enemies will adjust to player's level within region constraints
    - Ensures balanced challenge across different regions
  - `<!-- TODO: Add ambient music and travel animations -->`
    - Placeholder for background music per region
    - Animated transitions during travel (fade, slide, etc.)
    - Visual feedback for travel actions
  - `<!-- TODO: Add cutscenes for first arrival to new region -->`
    - Story moments when player first visits a region
    - Cinematic introductions for major locations
    - Integration with narrative progression system

#### Testing Checklist Implementation
The system now supports all 7 testing scenarios from Instructions.txt:

**1. Open World Map → See Only Unlocked Regions**
- ✅ WorldMapViewModel filters regions using `FastTravelService.IsUnlocked()`
- ✅ Only regions in `UnlockedRegions` collection are displayed
- ✅ Greenfield Town auto-unlocks if no regions unlocked
- ✅ Visual feedback shows only accessible regions

**2. Travel to a Region → Sometimes Trigger Random Battle**
- ✅ `EncounterService.ShouldTriggerEncounter()` called during travel
- ✅ Random chance of battle when traveling via World Map
- ✅ `OnRandomEncounter` event triggers battle if encounter occurs
- ✅ No encounter means smooth travel to destination

**3. Complete "Goblin Problem" Quest → Unlock "Goblin Woods"**
- ✅ BattleViewModel checks for quest completion
- ✅ When "Goblin Problem" quest completed:
  - Calls `FastTravelService.UnlockRegion("Goblin Woods")`
  - Adds message: "New region unlocked: Goblin Woods!"
- ✅ Region immediately available in Fast Travel and World Map
- ✅ Progress auto-saved after quest completion

**4. Use "Fast Travel" to Return to Earlier Towns**
- ✅ Fast Travel Expander in MapView lists unlocked regions
- ✅ "Travel to Region" button triggers direct travel
- ✅ No random encounters when using Fast Travel (safe method)
- ✅ Alternatively, "Fast Travel" button opens World Map (with encounters possible)
- ✅ Both methods support returning to previously visited regions

**5. Confirm Gold Decreases When Traveling**
- ✅ WorldMapViewModel.Travel() checks gold before travel
- ✅ Fixed cost: 10 gold per travel via World Map
- ✅ `Player.SpendGold(10)` deducts gold on travel
- ✅ Log message: "You spend 10 gold to travel."
- ✅ Insufficient gold (< 10) cancels travel with warning
- ✅ UI updates gold counter immediately after deduction

**6. Save, Exit, Reload → Verify Unlocked Regions and Last Location Persist**
- ✅ SaveLoadService saves `SaveData` with Player + UnlockedRegions
- ✅ Player.LastRegionName saved and restored on load
- ✅ FastTravelService.UnlockedRegions rehydrated from save file
- ✅ World Map and Fast Travel list show correct unlocked regions after reload
- ✅ Player spawns in last visited region on game load
- ✅ Backward compatibility with legacy save format

**7. Add TODO Placeholders** (as specified in Instructions.txt)
- ✅ `<!-- TODO: Add dynamic enemy scaling per region -->`
- ✅ `<!-- TODO: Add ambient music and travel animations -->`
- ✅ `<!-- TODO: Add cutscenes for first arrival to new region -->`

#### Technical Implementation Details

**WorldMapViewModel.Travel() Method**:// Check travel cost before traveling
int travelCost = 10;
if (Player.Gold >= travelCost)
{
    Player.SpendGold(travelCost);
    Debug.WriteLine($"You spend {travelCost} gold to travel.");
}
else
{
    Debug.WriteLine("Not enough gold to travel there.");
    return; // Cancel travel
}

// Unlock region for fast travel
FastTravelService.UnlockRegion(region.Name);

// Check for random encounter
if (EncounterService.ShouldTriggerEncounter())
{
    OnRandomEncounter?.Invoke(region.Name);
}
else
{
    OnRegionSelected?.Invoke(region);
}
**SaveLoadService SaveData Structure**:{
  "player": {
    "name": "Hero",
    "hp": 30,
    "maxHp": 30,
    "gold": 150,
    "lastRegionName": "Goblin Woods",
    // ... other player properties
  },
  "unlockedRegions": [
    "Greenfield Town",
    "Slime Plains",
    "Goblin Woods"
  ]
}
**BattleViewModel Quest Completion**:// Special handling for quest-based region unlocks
if (quest.Title == "Goblin Problem")
{
    FastTravelService.UnlockRegion("Goblin Woods");
    CombatLog.Add("New region unlocked: Goblin Woods!");
    _globalLog.Add("New region unlocked: Goblin Woods!");
