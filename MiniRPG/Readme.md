# MiniRPG - Change Log

## Latest Update: Save/Load System - Unlocked Regions Persistence

### New Features ✨

#### SaveLoadService - Extended Save File Format
- **Enhanced**: Save file format to include unlocked regions list
  - Added `SaveData` wrapper class containing:
    - `Player` object (all player data including stats, inventory, quests)
    - `UnlockedRegions` list (List<string> of region names unlocked for fast travel)
  - Provides comprehensive save state including world progression
- **Modified**: `SavePlayer()` method
  - Now serializes `FastTravelService.UnlockedRegions` collection
  - Creates `SaveData` object combining player and unlocked regions
  - Serializes to JSON with WriteIndented formatting
  - Debug output shows unlocked regions saved: `{string.Join(", ", saveData.UnlockedRegions)}`
  - Maintains existing backup system for save failures
  - Auto-saves unlocked regions on every save operation
- **Modified**: `LoadPlayer()` method
  - Attempts to deserialize new `SaveData` format first
  - Falls back to legacy `Player`-only format for compatibility
  - Rehydrates `FastTravelService.UnlockedRegions` from JSON:
    - Clears existing UnlockedRegions collection
    - Adds each saved region name to FastTravelService
  - Debug output shows loaded unlocked regions
  - Maintains stat recalculation and equipment bonus logic
  - Legacy format logs: "Loaded from legacy save format (no unlocked regions)"
- **Modified**: `ValidateSaveFile()` method
  - Updated to support both new SaveData and legacy Player formats
  - Validates new format first, falls back to legacy
  - Ensures save file integrity for both formats
- **Added TODO Comment**:
  - `// TODO: Add multi-save-slot world-state synchronization later`
  - Foundation for future multiple save slot system
  - World state includes: unlocked regions, quest progress, NPC states

#### Complete Save/Load Flow with Regions
1. **During Gameplay - Unlocking Regions**:
   - Player completes quests or visits new regions
   - `FastTravelService.UnlockRegion(regionName)` is called
   - Region added to `FastTravelService.UnlockedRegions` collection
   - ObservableCollection automatically updates UI
2. **Save Operation**:
   - Player manually saves or auto-save triggers
   - `SaveLoadService.SavePlayer(player)` called
   - Creates `SaveData` object:
     - `Player` = current player instance
     - `UnlockedRegions` = `FastTravelService.UnlockedRegions.ToList()`
   - Serializes SaveData to JSON with camelCase property names
   - Writes to `player_save.json` with backup created
   - Debug log shows all saved unlocked regions
3. **Load Operation**:
   - Application starts or player loads save
   - `SaveLoadService.LoadPlayer()` called
   - Deserializes JSON from `player_save.json`
   - Attempts new SaveData format first:
     - Extracts Player object
     - Extracts UnlockedRegions list
   - Clears `FastTravelService.UnlockedRegions`
   - Iterates through loaded region names:
     - Adds each to `FastTravelService.UnlockedRegions`
   - Debug log shows all loaded unlocked regions
   - Player object returned for game initialization
4. **UI Synchronization**:
   - Fast Travel ListBox bound to `FastTravelService.UnlockedRegions`
   - World Map regions filter based on unlocked status
   - UI automatically reflects loaded unlocked regions
   - No manual refresh needed due to ObservableCollection binding

#### Backward Compatibility with Legacy Saves
- **Legacy Format Support**:
  - Old saves contain only Player object (no SaveData wrapper)
  - LoadPlayer() detects format and deserializes appropriately
  - Legacy saves load successfully with no unlocked regions
  - Player can continue game without issues
  - Next save operation upgrades to new format automatically
- **Graceful Degradation**:
  - If new format deserialization fails, tries legacy format
  - Backup system supports both formats
  - Debug messages indicate format being loaded
  - No data loss during format migration

#### Integration Benefits
- **Persistent Fast Travel Progress**: Unlocked regions saved between sessions
- **Complete World State**: Save includes both player and world progression
- **Seamless Load Experience**: Fast travel regions immediately available on load
- **Quest Progression Preservation**: Region unlocks tied to quests persist
- **No Re-Exploration Required**: Players don't re-unlock visited regions
- **Auto-Save Integration**: Works with existing auto-save after battles/travel
- **Backward Compatible**: Legacy saves load without errors
- **Future-Proof**: Foundation for multi-save-slot system

#### User Experience Improvements
- **Progress Retention**: Players don't lose fast travel access on reload
- **Seamless Continuity**: Game state fully restored from save file
- **No Frustration**: Region unlock achievements preserved
- **Quick Resume**: Load game and fast travel immediately
- **Safe Experimentation**: Save/load system reliable for trying different paths
- **Clear Feedback**: Debug logs help diagnose save/load issues

#### Technical Details
- **SaveLoadService.cs Changes**:
  - Added `SaveData` class with Player and UnlockedRegions properties
  - Modified `SavePlayer()`:

- **JSON Structure**:{
  "player": {
    "name": "Hero",
    "hp": 30,
    "maxHp": 30,
    // ... other player properties
  },
  "unlockedRegions": [

    ]
  }- **Dependencies**:
  - FastTravelService for UnlockedRegions collection
